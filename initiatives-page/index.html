         <h3>2018</h3>
         <p>Our Rural Camp'18 was in the villages of Bheekampura and Gopalpura,Thanagazi tehsil, Alwar
          district in the state of Rajasthan from December 15,2018 to December 20, 2018. This camp was
          attended by 36 volunteers of NSS- DTU who were passionate about understanding the problems
          faced by people at the grassroot level of our country, the places where the benefits of modern
          education, technology and the rapid economic growth have not yet percolated. Yet, they were
          also aware of the immense value these villages had in teaching us about the sustainable manner
          of living in tune with the ways of nature- something the developed world seems to be in dire
          need of.
          Though the goal of this camp was to broaden our understanding of the conditions prevailing in
          these villages by living with them for some time, we were also successful in making some
          contributions to the village by means of solar panel installation and informative artwork in the
          community hall. Bheekampura is the village which serves as the headquarters for Tarun Bharat
          Sangh, an environmental NGO currently working in the field of water harvesting using
          innovative indigenous methods. They have been successful in mitigating the problem of water
          scarcity to a large extent in the drought prone state of Rajasthan. Gopalpura is an adjacent village
          housing a community of farmers and their families.

          December 27th, 2017 to January 1st, 2018. This camp was attended by 34 volunteers of
          NSS-DTU with a mission to bring about ground-level changes in the village and to understand
          the problems of rural India from the roots.
          Every NSS volunteer had summoned in their minds to stand up to their motto “Not Me But
          You”, by striving for selfless service to the village with full dedication and determination. We
          focussed on certain issues of prime importance such as Open defecation, Hygiene, Education,
          Career, govt. scheme implementation, etc. by organising various activities in the village.
          Harchandpur Kalan is a small village in the Etah district of western Uttar Pradesh with a
          population of approximately 1500 people. The most common occupations are farming, labour
          and cattle rearing.The camp was organised in collaboration with an NGO, Jaago India which is a

          The volunteers of National Service Scheme, Delhi Technological University (NSSDTU) made
          serious efforts to serve the purpose of their motto “Not me, but you” at the Special Rural Camp.
          Forty seven volunteers reached the village on the night of October 7 and were welcomed warmly
          by the villagers. The activities started early on the morning of the 8th of October. The camp
          activities aimed to increase our students’ knowledge and skills in social work practice by
          interacting with the rural community, learning about rural lifestyle, team spirit, sharing, planning
          and organizing programs etc as it provided ample opportunities for the students to fine tune their
          interpersonal relationship skills through the process of group dynamics. The students spread
          awareness, information, and organized various programs for the community during the rural
          camp.
